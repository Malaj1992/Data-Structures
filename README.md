Abstract characterizations as well as the design and implementation of data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, binary search trees, heaps, and graphs along with algorithms that make use of such structures including algorithms for sorting, searching, and memory management, will be studied. Algorithms will be analyzed for their asymptotic behavior in terms of time complexity and space requirements will be considered as well. Implementation issues will be considered and students will write programs that embody these data structures and algorithms.
